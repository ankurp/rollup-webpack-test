# rollup-webpack-test
Repo to demonstrate issue with webpack treeshaking when comparing with Rollup

## Getting Started

1. `yarn`
1. `yarn build`
1. Check `build` folder and examine the webpack and rollup bundles generated and notice webpack does not treeshake square and cube functions where as rollup does.
